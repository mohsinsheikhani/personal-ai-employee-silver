# Orchestration Logic for Email Assistant

## Component Selection Matrix

| User Request Pattern | Primary Component | Supporting Components |
|---|---|---|
| "Write an email" | email-drafter | email-templates, Gmail MCP |
| "Use the follow-up template" | email-templates | email-drafter, Gmail MCP |
| "Summarize this thread" | email-summarizer | - |
| "Triage my inbox" | inbox-triager | email-summarizer, Gmail MCP |
| "Suggest a response" | response-suggester | email-drafter |
| "What needs follow-up?" | follow-up-tracker | email-templates, Gmail MCP |
| "Help me manage email" | ORCHESTRATOR | ALL components |

## Workflow Sequencing

### Sequential Dependencies

Tasks that must complete before the next can begin:

1. **Triage BEFORE Suggest** — Need priority context before generating response options
2. **Summarize BEFORE Respond** — Need thread context before drafting reply
3. **Draft BEFORE Send** — Need email content before sending

### Parallel Opportunities

Tasks that can run simultaneously:
- Triage multiple email batches in parallel
- Draft multiple responses while user reviews first
- Track follow-ups while composing new emails

## State Management

### Session State

Information maintained during active session:
- Current inbox snapshot (from last triage)
- Active drafts pending review
- Follow-up queue with deadlines

### Persistent State

Information stored in skill references:
- Tone guidelines (in email-drafter/references/)
- Templates (in email-templates/templates/)
- Priority contact list (in inbox-triager configuration)

## Offline Mode Workflow

When Gmail MCP is unavailable:

1. **Skill invocation works normally** — All content generation functions
2. **Subagent analysis works with provided data** — User can paste email content
3. **Output format changes**:
   - Email content copied to clipboard
   - Manual instructions provided
   - User notified of offline status

## Quality Gates

Before any email is sent:

1. Tone matches guidelines
2. Template variables fully substituted (no {{placeholders}} remaining)
3. Recipient address verified
4. Draft reviewed if importance level high
5. User confirmed send action explicitly
